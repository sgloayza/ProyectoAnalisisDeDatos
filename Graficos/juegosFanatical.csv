DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model. Damage can be repaired by hiring Engineers to work in the team’s Service Area between stages but with a finite amount of time available.",Codemasters

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

FIBBAGE 3 (2-8 players) In this blanking fun sequel, players have access to a new interactivity with the audience by letting them add their own lies to the selection. Fibbage 3 also includes a new separate game mode – Fibbage: Enough About You – which replaces the traditional questions with questions relating to your fellow players. SURVIVE THE INTERNET (3-8 players) Twist your friends’ “online” comments in hilarious ways in this web-based frame game. In Survive the Internet, one player receives a question that asks their opinion on a topic – their answer is then taken out of context and sent to another player, who is then told to determine what the reply was, whilst attempting to twist the words to make the first player look bad. All players are with the original replies and the guessed topic, and must vote on which is the silliest. Each vote earns points for the second player and a smaller number for the first player that provided the reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner! MONSTER SEEKING MONSTER (3-7 players) Disguise yourself as a monster and attempt to date other players in the spooky Monster Seeking Monster. Players can send up to four messages to other players and, if the audience is participating, they can use lib-style prompts to select phrases to send. Each player then selects another player/monster that they would like to date based on the replies. If two players select each other, they both earn a heart. The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game – don’t forget to use your monster super powers to score bonuses too! BRACKETEERING (3-16 players) The deranged debate match game where players place smart bets on stupid arguments. In Bracketeering, players are given a prompt to complete with funniest answer they can, with the answers randomly placed on a tournament-style grid. The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and must guess which answer will win that match up – the answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins. CIVIC DOODLE (3-8 players) Civic Doodle will test your doodling skills as two players compete against one another in each round. Players have a short time to draw, with audience members providing real-time feedback on either drawing with preselected emojis. At the end of each round, players and the audience then vote for which drawing is better, with points going to both players based on how many votes they received, as well as an additional bonus points for emoji votes.

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

All players are with the original replies and the guessed topic, and must vote on which is the silliest.

The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and must guess which answer will win that match up – the answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins.

A QUEST FOR A PROMISED LAND The Vaulters have spent centuries seeking a home. Stranded on the world of Auriga, they had to survive the harsh climate and even harsher neighbors. Once more among the stars, following their uncontested leader Ilona Zolya, the people that now call themselves the Aurigans still seek traces of their past as well as a safe place to finally call home.

Their skills range from great system defense bonuses to improved scientific output. The Vaulters Expansion also marks the return of Opbot DV8 as an unlockable hero. … POWERFUL FLEETS… Reminiscing of Mezari designs of old on Auriga, the new Vaulters ships are much like their makers: resilient, sturdy, gorgeous to a fault. They are reliant on a high number of defense modules, along with strong support capacities, that make them a tough opponent in battle. One of the new exotic modules will even allow you to board enemy ships and eventually take total control of them. …AND MERCILESS ALLIES. Once living in Auriga as a group of warrior clerics, the Sisters of Mercy joined the Vaulters in their quest for a new home. As a minor faction, they will fight for justice and show no mercy to evil forces. WILL YOU BEFRIEND THE INFAMOUS PIRATES? Pirate Diplomacy is a new powerful tool to get along with these space outlaws. In exchange for payment, you can now get a special treatment by supporting them, and even use them to ruthlessly attack other factions. Vaulters have even the special ability to mask their ships as Pirates.

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

The Jackbox Party Pack,19.11,27%,steam,Jackbox Games Inc.,"November 26, 2014","","You're gonna need more than one party for this Long gone are quiet nights in watching the same old TV shows – The Jackbox Party Pack is here! Experience five fun Steam PC games in one great pack – giving you the perfect excuse for rounding up friends, family and fellow gamers for a few hours of gaming delight – whatever the day, whatever the occasion. Hosted on your Windows PC or Apple Mac through Steam, your phones or tablets are your controllers – with games suitable for 1-100 players. YOU DON'T KNOW JACK Its high culture meets pop culture! In You Don't Know Jack games, four players are tasked to answer multiple choice trivia questions presented. You’ll score points via in-game money for answering questions correctly and in a shorter amount of time – but be careful – you will lose money give the wrong answer. At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most cash. FIBBAGE XL In Fibbage XL, a player selects from one of five random categories in each round of the game, with an obscure fact presented with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player must use their device to enter a reply for the missing words. If players enter the right answer, they are asked to enter something different. The game then presents all replies – including the correct one – which prompts the players to select what they think is the right answer. You’ll score points for selecting the right answer, but you can also pick up bonus points if other players select your reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner! DRAWFUL In Drawful, each player is given a playful phrase and a drawing canvas on their local device at the start of each round. They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase before presenting it to all other players – where they must enter a phrase of what they think the picture represents. All replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are then presented to the players for them to vote of what they think the original phrase was – and the artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets – simple! LIE SWATTER As the name suggests, let’s swat some lies! Lie Swatter challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, ""swatting"" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones.

The Jackbox Party Pack,19.11,27%,steam,Jackbox Games Inc.,"November 26, 2014","","You're gonna need more than one party for this Long gone are quiet nights in watching the same old TV shows – The Jackbox Party Pack is here! Experience five fun Steam PC games in one great pack – giving you the perfect excuse for rounding up friends, family and fellow gamers for a few hours of gaming delight – whatever the day, whatever the occasion. Hosted on your Windows PC or Apple Mac through Steam, your phones or tablets are your controllers – with games suitable for 1-100 players. YOU DON'T KNOW JACK Its high culture meets pop culture! In You Don't Know Jack games, four players are tasked to answer multiple choice trivia questions presented. You’ll score points via in-game money for answering questions correctly and in a shorter amount of time – but be careful – you will lose money give the wrong answer. At the end of the game, the winner is the player with the most cash. FIBBAGE XL In Fibbage XL, a player selects from one of five random categories in each round of the game, with an obscure fact presented with a missing word or phrase to complete it. Each player must use their device to enter a reply for the missing words. If players enter the right answer, they are asked to enter something different. The game then presents all replies – including the correct one – which prompts the players to select what they think is the right answer. You’ll score points for selecting the right answer, but you can also pick up bonus points if other players select your reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner! DRAWFUL In Drawful, each player is given a playful phrase and a drawing canvas on their local device at the start of each round. They have a short amount of time to draw out that phrase before presenting it to all other players – where they must enter a phrase of what they think the picture represents. All replies, along with the actual phrase for that picture, are then presented to the players for them to vote of what they think the original phrase was – and the artist of the picture gets points for every vote that guessed their original phrase, while those who wrote other phrases get points for votes their phrase gets – simple! LIE SWATTER As the name suggests, let’s swat some lies! Lie Swatter challenges up to 100 players to correctly guess if presented trivia statements are true or not, ""swatting"" those that are false. Players earn points for correct answers and lose points for incorrect ones. WORD SPUD In Word Spud, a word is presented and one player at a time must come up with another word that is associated with it. The remaining players vote if the association is good or not.

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

Espire 1: VR Operative,31.5,,steam,Digital Lode,"November 22, 2019","","Espire 1: VR Operative aims to set the new gold standard for the stealth genre in virtual reality –introducing the “Control Theatre,” a unique solution to the challenge of VR motion sickness for first-person titles. Espire 1: VR Operative drafts players as drone operators of the future. Players become “Espire Agents” and use cutting-edge Virtual Reality hardware to remote-operate the Espire model 1 from the safety of their Control Theatre.The technology behind the Control Theatre and the game’s approach to movement lie at the heart of Espire 1: VR Operative’s gameplay and intuitive VR control system. Any time a player performs any artificial locomotion, the game world shrinks down to the size of a floating tablet, with the Control Theatre visible in the player’s peripheral vision. This “VR within VR” system allows for precise, full freedom movement, while maintaining immersion, and eliminating “VR motion sickness” for almost everyone. The Control Theatre is fully customizable to suit the player’s level of comfort, and can be fully disabled for those already comfortable moving in VR.Espire 1: VR Operative Key Features Include:* The definitive VR stealth experience: bringing the stealth genre to the exciting medium of Virtual Reality, delivering gameplay mechanics for the stealth and action genres that have yet to be explored.* Full freedom of movement: allowing players the freedom to move anywhere within their virtual environment, moving, climbing, and falling with full comfort and no motion sickness for almost all players.* Complete single-player story, rich in detail: developed as a dedicated single player VR experience with individual story missions and scenario missions that use the story mission environments for short challenges.* Voice control: Using the VR headset’s onboard microphone, players can make commands and perform actions simply by speaking. The noises players make can draw the enemy to their location – adding a new way to gain the advantage.* Arsenal of weapons and gadgets: As an Espire model 1 Operative, players will have access to dozens of unique gadgets and weapons such as a tranquilizer pistol and deployable spy cameras in order to complete the mission objectives.* Global Leaderboard: A worldwide tally awards players a competitive score based on mission time, movement, stealth, ammo conservation, takedowns and other factors.* Intuitive controls that mimic real life: Interaction in this game aims to be natural and intuitive. Instead of memorizing dozens of button combinations for every action, players perform them as they would in real life. Operatives can crouch and enter cover by physically using their body.* Smart AI: Enemy combatants in this game actively hunt the player. The AI responds to sight, sound, and other stimuli and will react to with varying levels of suspicion based on the player’s physical stance, movement speed, cover and relative location.",Tripwire Interactive

Fibbage 3 also includes a new separate game mode – Fibbage: Enough About You – which replaces the traditional questions with questions relating to your fellow players. SURVIVE THE INTERNET (3-8 players) Twist your friends’ “online” comments in hilarious ways in this web-based frame game. In Survive the Internet, one player receives a question that asks their opinion on a topic – their answer is then taken out of context and sent to another player, who is then told to determine what the reply was, whilst attempting to twist the words to make the first player look bad. All players are with the original replies and the guessed topic, and must vote on which is the silliest. Each vote earns points for the second player and a smaller number for the first player that provided the reply. The player with the most points at the end is the winner! MONSTER SEEKING MONSTER (3-7 players) Disguise yourself as a monster and attempt to date other players in the spooky Monster Seeking Monster. Players can send up to four messages to other players and, if the audience is participating, they can use lib-style prompts to select phrases to send.

The player with the most hearts at the end wins the game – don’t forget to use your monster super powers to score bonuses too! BRACKETEERING (3-16 players) The deranged debate match game where players place smart bets on stupid arguments. In Bracketeering, players are given a prompt to complete with funniest answer they can, with the answers randomly placed on a tournament-style grid. The players are then given one of the tournament matchups and must guess which answer will win that match up – the answer that gets the highest percentage of votes wins. CIVIC DOODLE (3-8 players) Civic Doodle will test your doodling skills as two players compete against one another in each round. Players have a short time to draw, with audience members providing real-time feedback on either drawing with preselected emojis.

Dead Rising® 2,5.53,73%,steam,Blue Castle Games,"September 27, 2010","","The sequel to the million-plus selling Dead Rising, Dead Rising 2 sees the player take on the role of former Motocross champion Chuck Greene, who has come to Fortune City, America's newest gambling paradise, to compete in “Terror is Reality,” a gruesome game show that dares contestants to survive zombie-filled environments for big money prizes at the delight of TV audiences around the globe. Chuck’s motivation for taking part and risking life and limb is his daughter Katey, who since being bitten by a zombie requires a daily dose of Zombrex to prevent her from turning into one of the living dead. There’s no denying that Zombrex works, but since it’s the only drug on the market, its price is high. During his time in Fortune City a zombie outbreak occurs and Chuck must survive the onslaught of the undead for 72 hours. Pitted against two fearsome threats – tens of thousands of zombies and the constant countdown of the clock – while potentially rescuing other survivors of the zombie apocalypse, players must also unravel the greater conspiracy behind the outbreak and as importantly find the Zombrex necessary to stop Katey from joining the ever growing zombie horde. Players will shoot, stab, carve and drive their way through enemies in order to beat the clock and survive 72hours in the darkly comedic, no holds-barred confines of Fortune City. Dead Rising 2 will deliver more of the signature gameplay that the series is known for plus a number of new features. Players who might need some help or simply want to share the zombie bashing fun with a friend will now be able to play in online 2-player co-op. Simply use the in-game transceiver to call for assistance at any time and once your partner has accepted, they will arrive by your side for double the action. With hundreds of zombies on screen at any one time, the original Dead Rising forced gamers to take everyday objects they found in the Mall and use them as weapons. But now, in Dead Rising 2 with thousands of zombies filling every square inch of Fortune City, Chuck is going to need to be even more resourceful and inventive by creating combination weapons to save the day. Players will be able to take two objects, a roll of tape and with a little inventiveness create an advanced zombie-killing combo weapon - a piece of wood and a lawnmower become Portamower, the handheld mower that cuts zombies down to size in an instant; while a garden rake and car battery combine to create an electrified zombie prod. The more combo weapons a player uses, the more Prestige Points (PPs) they will gain along the way in order to level up Chuck. Key Features ",Capcom

Dragon Ball FighterZ - Ultimate Edition,120.52,,steam,Arc System Works,"January 26, 2018","","Become the ULTIMATE fighter Charge your Ki and unleash fury in the action-packed fighting game Dragon Ball FighterZ, now available on Steam PC and console. A Dragon Ball game for newcomers and fans alike, this 2.5D arcade-style fighter promises intense close-quarter battles with the ability to kick your opponents through mountains and blast them into space with a destructive finish! With Guilty Gear developer Ark System Works at the helm, expect an electrifying joyride of non-stop combat between the likes of Super Saiyans, Gods, Androids and hybrid mutants. SUPER COMBAT Fight your way to the top and become the ultimate fighter in 3v3 tag battles. Unlike the Dragon Ball Xenoverse games, these fights are more compact – urging players to get up close and personal with a flurry of combos and testing their defensive skills. THE SAGA CONTINUES Help discover the threat behind the clone army and mysterious energy-draining waves. Using the LINK system, players will be absorbed into the body of some of the world’s most powerful and deadliest fighters to help them regain strength and defeat foes. Experience a true Dragon Ball storyline featuring a host of heroes and villains from the popular anime series, with the introduction of a new character – Android 21 – supervised by Dragon Ball anime creator Akira Toriyama himself. This campaign features a tactical map layout – leaving the player in control of gaining experience points, saving characters from evil clones to allow them to use said fighter in their roster, and taking on the main boss in each chapter. Be cautious, you’ll only have so many moves to make and certain enemies will become stronger the longer you wait to confront them. Play through three unique sagas, depicting the story from a different perspective in each one. GAME MODES GALORE From the Central Hub, where players will be able to customize their own Dragon Ball avatar, you’ll be able to access a number of game modes. Battling against AI in the training mode will help you memorize super attacks and combos before heading into the story or arcade modes, as well as prepping you for some tough battles in online multiplayer. In Party mode, each player controls one of six fighters in a single battle – each switching into play. In Circle Match mode, up to eight players can enter the room to fight against each other. The World Match mode allows players to choose between casual and ranked matches, with online leaderboards keeping score of player rankings.

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

DiRT 4 - Steam Game,2.04,90%,steam,Codemasters,"June 09, 2017","","Motorsport by its very nature is dangerous. DiRT 4 is all about embracing that danger. It’s about the thrill, exhilaration and adrenaline that is absolutely vital to off-road racing. And more than that, it’s about loving that feeling. It’s about pushing flat out next to a sheer cliff drop. Going for the gap that’s slightly too small. Seeing how much air you can get in a truck. They call it ‘being fearless’. DiRT 4 also features a game-changing system called Your Stage; an innovative rally route creation tool that allows you to produce an almost-infinite number of unique stages at the press of a button. You choose your location and set the route parameters, then Your Stage does the hard work to create a unique rally stage that you can race, share with your friends and then challenge them to beat your time. Your Stage allows experienced rally players to create longer, more technical routes, whilst newcomers can create simpler shorter routes as they hone their skills. With DiRT 4, Codemasters have sought to combine the levels of thrill and realism from last year’s DiRT Rally with the fearless excitement, accessibility and adrenaline-fuelled races previously seen in its critically acclaimed prequels DiRT 2 and DiRT 3. Featuring classic rally racing that continues to build on the foundations set by the Colin McRae Rally games, the bruising contests from the official FIA World Rallycross Championship, the crazy battles of racing trucks and buggies, and the outrageous fun of open events in Joyride, players will face challenges from locations that span three continents. • OVER 50 OF THE MOST BREATH-TAKING OFF-ROAD CARS EVER BUILT – Including Ford Fiesta R5, Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution VI, Subaru WRX STI NR4 and Audi Sport quattro S1 E2• 5 INCREDIBLE RALLY LOCATIONS WITH MILLIONS OF ROUTES – Australia, Spain, Michigan, Sweden & Wales• THE OFFICIAL GAME OF THE FIA WORLD RALLYCROSS CHAMPIONSHIP – Race at Montalegre, Lohéac Bretagne, Hell, Holjes & Lydden Hill in a multitude of different series• LANDRUSH – Short-course dirt track racing in Pro Buggies, Pro-2 Trucks, Pro-4 Trucks and Crosskart vehicles in California, Nevada and Mexico• JOYRIDE - Laptime challenges, smash challenges, free-play area and send challenges to friends• DiRT ACADEMY – Taking place at the DirtFish Rally School in Washington, USA, learn the skills, techniques and practice to become the best!• CAREER MODE – create your driver, compete across the disciplines, gain sponsors and build your team with clear goals and rewards• COMPETITIVE GAMING – Daily, weekly and month-long challenges against fellow players from around the world• NEXT GENERATION OF RACENET – Live ladder, leagues and tournaments, cross-platform leaderboards, enhanced CREST telemetry system• TUNING – Tweak your set-up based on vehicle, track and weather conditions to best suit your racing style• DAMAGE & REPAIRS – Wear and tear is faithfully recreated with an improved and realistic damage model.

Now, the restless rascals at WarfareSims are back at it with a vengeance! The already legendary game of modern cross-domain operations returns with an all-new UI, even more refined simulation mechanics and a host of new features and content to engross you into the challenges of warfare post-WW2 and in the 21st century. Are you ready? Are you up to it?No man, and no armed service, is an island. Aircraft, ships, submarines, ground forces and installations, satellites and even strategic weapons are at your disposal. You are given the forces and their hardware; but you have to direct them wisely.You asked for a faster, smoother earth-globe interface with richer, even more detailed map layers - and you got it! Over half a terabyte's worth of satellite imagery and terrain elevation combine to deliver an unprecedentedly crisp battlefield for your forces to roam. Command's new slick, dark-themed UI slams you right into the seat of a modern-day military command center and never lets go. Play in desktop-standard window or gamelike full-screen mode. Arrange your secondary info windows just how you like them - or park them into extra monitors. Customize your map and info windows to perfection to suit your play style.Hundreds of changes and additions to gameplay based directly on user feedback means the game is now yours more than ever. Minimaps? Check. Quickly load recent scenarios or saves? Yup. Real-time dynamic ORBATs of both friendly forces and known contacts? Yessir. Time-step sim execution to prevent “runaway sim”? Can do. Glorious victories or crushing defeats have never felt so easy to experience.Don’t spend too long gawking at the pretty maps, because the battlefield is even more alive and ready to crush you! Expanded ground ops let you take advantage of distinct terrain types (desert, forest, urban, swamps etc.) for mobility, weapon effects and visibility. Enhanced AI routines for dogfights and even more technical factors make your grip on air superiority more tenuous.

Your war machines are crewed or remote-controlled by human beings: people trained with varied proficiency (from novice to ace), operating under custom doctrine and rules of engagement (when to do what, how to decide, how to react etc.), most of the time making the rational decision, and sometimes making a brilliant call or a mistake.

Command: Modern Operations,60.4,30%,steam,WarfareSims,"November 14, 2019","","THE KING IS BACK.The first release of Command rocked the foundations of modern PC wargaming, steamrolled its way into the Pentagon and won numerous ""Wargame Of The Year"" awards.

Minimaps? Check. Quickly load recent scenarios or saves? Yup. Real-time dynamic ORBATs of both friendly forces and known contacts? Yessir. Time-step sim execution to prevent “runaway sim”? Can do.

Train Simulator: Inselbahn: Stralsund – Sassnitz Route Add-On,17.8,48%,steam,Dovetail Games,"April 18, 2019","","The scenic island railway that traverses the hills of Rügen between Stralsund and Sassnitz has arrived for Train Simulator.The 1860s, iron rails were rapidly spreading throughout Germany, including those of the Angermünde–Stralsund railway which was built to shorten journey times between the north of the country and Sweden. There was however an opportunity to get rails even closer to the Baltic border, the island of Rügen.It would not be until 1883 when a railway on Rügen soil was built. It originally stretched as far as Bergen auf Rügen to begin with, and was extended 8 years later to reach the northern coast of the island at Sassnitz. At this point however, there was no fixed crossing with the mainland, instead, the body of water known as the Strelasund was traversed by ferry.Traffic steadily grew in popularity as Germany and Sweden were ever closer linked. Mail would cross borders via Rügen faster than ever before, and eventually, a railway ferry was established between the two countries to bring them even closer together. The success of the ferry urged a greater connection to the mainland, and so in the 1930s a bridge was built over the Strelasund.It wasn’t just Sassnitz and Sweden that benefitted from the island railway, the coastal town of Binz also found itself served by a single track branch line from Lietzow, and today serves as an equally important destination with every other train terminating there.Following electrification, and the fall of the iron curtain, Rügen has become something of a holiday resort and has been referred to as “Brighton for Berliners” by those who have reviewed its Baltic coastline; and what better way to go on a summer holiday than by scenic rail!Inselbahn: Stralsund – Sassnitz brings both passenger and freight flavours of island rail operations to life!",Dovetail Games  Trains
